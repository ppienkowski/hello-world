# hello-world
My first repository

I am currently a college student exploring options for my future. 
I have began to like the computer science route.
Since I will not be taking any classes in that field anytime soon, 
I have began to teach myself the basics of programming.
I am however familiar with HTML5 but very little. Just the basics as well.
HTML is more of a web developer so it is alot more straight forward.
Currently I am reading the book, Learning Python The Hard Way.
Reading it is quite confusing but i catch on pretty quickly. 
I am here because I hope i can get some kind of experience of creating
my own small projects with the help of proffessionals. I am not very
creative so honestly i would not even know where to begin.
